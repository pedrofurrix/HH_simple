Adapted into different python classes, flexibility introduced with variable number of compartments, extracellular mechanism and possibility of stimulation.

## Usage
Clone the repository, go into mechanisms and compile, by writing "mknrndll" on the console.
**test_EC.ipynb** - for extracellular stimulation, run , choosing between the rx and stim methods.
**test_electrode.ipynb** - with a current clamp similar to the paper - can recreate the obtained results.
Change the cell class as you see fit.
